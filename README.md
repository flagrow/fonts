# Fonts by ![flagrow logo](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16413865?v=3&s=20) [flagrow](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/1832-flagrow-extension-developer-group), a project of [Gravure](https://gravure.io/).

Easily add Google Fonts to your Flarum install.

## Install

    composer require flagrow/fonts

Don't have Composer on your server ? You can also install it with [Bazaar](https://github.com/flagrow/bazaar).

## Usage

Before you start using the extension, create a [Google Fonts API Key](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api#identifying_your_application_to_google) and save it in the extension settings (you should automatically get a prompt after enabling the extension).

Go to the Admin panel > Fonts to enable fonts.

Use them in your posts with the `[font]` BBCode. For example:

    [font=Fresca]Hello World[/font]

**Don't forget**: adding many fonts will increase your website size and load time.
Keep them to a minimum.
